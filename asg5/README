Project description: To translate Python functions, including scope resolution and return value propogation. Also, my solution is able to translate if/else and the six relational operators: <, <=, ==, >, >=, ! =. Based on the previous project, I added several test cases to evaluate my interpreter. All of them pass if you execute command "./test.py", which compares the result that a Python 2.7.6 interpreter produces and my interpreter returns. I also handled the memory leak problem and avoided double free error. When you run command "valgrind ./run cases/main.py", it shows my solution is free of leaks. 

The easiest part of this project: Translate if/else.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Handle scope resolution.
